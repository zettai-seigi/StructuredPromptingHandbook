Arrow leads to PHASE 2 Adoption (teal): Apply Patterns, Duration 4-8 weeks, Focus on Daily use, Templates, Patterns. Arrow leads to PHASE 3 Optimization (orange): Optimize Results, Duration 2-4 months, Focus on Metrics, Testing, Refinement. Arrow leads to PHASE 4 Mastery (green): Lead Others, Duration Ongoing, Focus on Mentoring, Innovation, Community. Each phase box shows duration and key focus areas below.]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/Figure_17.1.jpeg){: .img-fluid }
