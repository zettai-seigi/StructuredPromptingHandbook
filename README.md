## The 7 Prompting Pillars

| Pillar | Name | Focus Area |
|--------|------|------------|
| 1 | **Clarity** | Unambiguous communication |
| 2 | **Context** | Relevant background information |
| 3 | **Constraint** | Boundaries and limitations |
| 4 | **Composition** | Structure and formatting |
| 5 | **Calibration** | Tone, style, and persona |
| 6 | **Chain** | Logical sequencing and reasoning |
| 7 | **Critique** | Self-evaluation and refinement |

---

## The 5 Quality Dimensions

1. **Relevance** - Response addresses the actual request
2. **Accuracy** - Information is factually correct
3. **Completeness** - All aspects of the request are covered
4. **Coherence** - Response is logically structured
5. **Actionability** - Output can be directly used

---

## The 4 Maturity Levels

| Level | Name | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| 1 | **Novice** | Basic prompts, trial-and-error approach |
| 2 | **Practitioner** | Structured prompts, consistent patterns |
| 3 | **Expert** | Advanced techniques, systematic optimization |
| 4 | **Master** | Framework design, teaching others |

---

## The 6 Control Objectives

1. **Accuracy Control** - Ensure factual correctness
2. **Consistency Control** - Maintain reproducible outputs
3. **Safety Control** - Prevent harmful content generation
4. **Privacy Control** - Protect sensitive information
5. **Compliance Control** - Meet regulatory requirements
6. **Quality Control** - Maintain output standards
